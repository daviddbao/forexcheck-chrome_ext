# forexcheck-chrome_ext

This Google Chrome browser extension displays data on Foreign Exchange rates.

Data is provided via Investing.com, who in turn gets this data from market makers, so it may not be totally up to date with current ForEx market activity.

I made this small and simple extension to learn a little about developing Chrome extensions.

To use:
1. Download project
2. Go to "chrome://extensions/" in your Chrome (or Chromium-based browser) URL bar
3. Check the "Developer mode" switch in the upper right-hand corner
4. Select "Load unpacked" in the upper left-hand coner, select directory where this project is saved
5. Use "Ctrl+Shift+F" to open the extension, hover over with mouse to view ForEx data
